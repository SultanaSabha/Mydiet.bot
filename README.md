# Mydiet.bot
Built an AI-powered diet assistant using Streamlit, LangChain, and ChromaDB that delivers context-aware nutrition insights through retrieval-augmented generation.

🥗 MyDiet.Bot – AI-Powered Diet & Nutrition Assistant

MyDiet.Bot is an AI-powered conversational nutrition assistant built using Python and Streamlit that provides personalized diet and food-related guidance through natural language interaction. The application leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to answer user queries by combining a language model with a vector database for accurate, context-aware responses.

The system ingests nutrition and diet-related data, generates embeddings, and stores them in a ChromaDB vector store. When a user asks a question, the application retrieves the most relevant information using semantic search and generates a concise, user-friendly response. This approach improves reliability compared to standalone language models.

The project demonstrates practical experience in LLM-based applications, time-efficient data ingestion pipelines, and interactive web app development. It highlights real-world skills in building AI assistants, managing embeddings, and deploying user-facing analytics tools.
